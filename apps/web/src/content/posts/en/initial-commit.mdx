## Initial commit 📝

Fun fact, I always start my personal projects with this commit message

```bash
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

kind of over the years I've seen this habit as a sign of good luck.

### Who I am 👷

Well, I'm Julio, working as a software developer for a few years now and during this time I've been able to work with various products from different niches and also with different languages and technologies.

Always willing and curious to learn new things.

**Tech-stack**: *Javascript, Typescript, React, React Native, Nodejs, Golang, MS Azure, AWS, Firebase, Object-Oriented Programming, Clean Architecture, DDD, Unit Tests, Integration Tests, E2E tests, and Software Architecture.*

I've also had the pleasure of contributing to open-source projects, such as:

[oracle/pushiomanager-react-native](https://github.com/oracle/pushiomanager-react-native/pull/56) <br />
[facebook/react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/39265) (Yes, it was just a comment, but it would have saved me a few hours 😅)

### Hobbies 🎨

Basically throughout my entire life I've been a fan of gaming culture, anime, and movies. Lately, I've been acquiring some board games to play with friends and family. I also enjoy practicing sports like swimming, soccer, and skateboarding (I did it for about 5 years in my teens). Currently, I'm learning to play the drums and on weekends, I do some drawings to take a break and relax a bit.

### Blog Objective 💡

Introduction done, getting straight to the point. My main goal with this blog is to consolidate my knowledge on topics I've been studying and personal projects. I intend to use the blog as a "summary" of the entire development process, and as a side-effect, I hope to help other people who may eventually access the posts.

I'm not used to writing, and I'm slowly getting back into the habit of reading, so probably many mistakes will be made in these first posts, but that will be corrected over time.

I hope it's valuable and adds knowledge to anyone who comes across it. ✨
